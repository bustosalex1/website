Things about NumPy that I am prone to forgetting.

### Axis Ordering

- 2D NumPy arrays are ordered as shown.

### Indexing

- To get a row of a two-dimensional array as a one-dimensional array, you can
  use a single index. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    bar = np.array(
        [
            [5, 10, 15, 20],
            [25, 30, 35, 40],
            [45, 50, 55, 60],
        ]
    )

    print(bar[0])  # prints array([ 5, 10, 15, 20])
    ```

- To get a row of a two-dimensional array as a two-dimensional array, you can
  use `None` or slicing. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    bar = np.array(
        [
            [5, 10, 15, 20],
            [25, 30, 35, 40],
            [45, 50, 55, 60],
        ]
    )

    print(bar[0, None])  # prints array([[5, 10, 15, 20]])

    print(bar[:1])  # also prints array([[5, 10, 15, 20]])
    ```

- You can index a list of specific elements in a two-dimensional array by
  passing in a list of the points' row and column indices. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    bar = np.array(
        [
            [5, 10, 15, 20],
            [25, 30, 35, 40],
            [45, 50, 55, 60],
        ]
    )

    print(bar[[0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 2]])
    # array([5, 30, 55])
    ```

- When every dimension of an array is indexed with an array, and each of those
  arrays is the same shape, the output of the indexing operation will be the
  same shape as the index arrays. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    foo = np.arange(3 * 2 * 4).reshape((3, 2, 4))
    print(foo)
    # [[[ 0  1  2  3]
    #   [ 4  5  6  7]]
    #
    #  [[ 8  9 10 11]
    #   [12 13 14 15]]
    #
    #  [[16 17 18 19]
    #   [20 21 22 23]]]

    print(foo[[[0, 2], [2, 0], [1, 1]], [[0, 0], [0, 0], [1, 1]], [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3]]])
    # [[ 0 17]
    #  [16  2]
    #  [12 15]]
    ```

- If index arrays are not the same shape, but can be broadcasted, the output of
  the indexing operation will be the same shape as the broadcasted array.

### Broadcasting

- Suppose we want to add two arrays, `A` and `B`.

    - Moving backwards from the last dimension of each array, we check if their
      dimensions are compatible.
    - **Dimensions are compatible if they are equal or either of them is one.**
    - If all of `A`'s dimensions are compatible with `B`'s dimensions, or vice
      versa, they are compatible arrays.

### Reshaping Arrays

- You can insert new axes in front of and behind existing axes using `None` or
  `np.newaxis` (which is just an alias for `None`). For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    A = np.array(
        [5, 10, 15, 20],
    )

    print(A[:, np.newaxis].shape)  # prints (4, 1)
    print(A[np.newaxis, :].shape)  # prints (1, 4)
    ```

- You can reshape arrays in-place by modifying the `shape` attribute instead of
  using `reshape`. For example:

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    A = np.array(
        [
            [1, 2, 3, 4],
            [5, 6, 7, 8],
        ],
    )

    A.reshape(4, 2)  # creates a copy of `A` and reshapes the copy
    A.shape = (4, 2)  # directly modifies `A`
    ```

### Logical Indexing

- To combine logical statements, use bitwise operators like `&` and `|`.
- When combining logical statements, each statement should be wrapped with
  parentheses, so that they are evaluated before the any bitwise operators.

### NaN

- `np.nan` is a special floating point constant. It cannot be inserted into
  arrays of non-floating point values.
- Use `np.isnan()` to find `np.nan` values in an array. `np.nan` is designed in
  such a way that `np.nan == np.nan` evaluates to `False`, but
  `np.nan != np.nan` evaluates to `True.`

### Math Functions

- NumPy has a number of math functions that behave similarly.

    ```python
    import numpy as np

    bar = np.array(
        [
            [5.0, 2.0, 9.0],
            [1.0, 0.0, 2.0],
            [1.0, 7.0, 8.0],
        ]
    )

    # prints 35.0, the sum of all elements in `bar`
    print(np.sum(bar))

    # prints array([7., 9., 19.]), the column sums of the array
    print(np.sum(bar, axis=0))

    # prints array([16., 3., 16.]), the row sums of the array
    print(np.sum(bar, axis=1))

    # Note that in the above cases, `sum` returns a 1D array. To retain the
    # dimensions of `bar`, set `keepdims=True`. For example, the following prints
    # array[[16.], [3.], [16.]].
    print(np.sum(bar, axis=1, keepdims=True))
    ```

- If any values in an array are `nan` and you try to apply `sum` to the array,
  it will return `nan`, since by default it is not expecting `nan` values in the
  array. `np.nansum` will instead treat `nan` values as `0`.
