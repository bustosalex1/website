### Overview

This was a project I did for a graduate class, _ME 6104: Computer Aided
Design_, which primarily focused on understanding some of the fundamental
building blocks of modern parametric CAD software and implementing some of
these concepts (like Bézier curves and surfaces) with Python.

For the course's final project, I worked with a classmate to build a simple web
app (displayed above) with Svelte, Three.js / Threlte, TailwindCSS, and
DaisyUI. The app is designed with the intent of giving some intuition to the
way Bézier curves and surfaces work by allowing users to interact with curves
and surfaces in a 3D environment and visualize how each of the control points
of the curve affect the value of the curve (shown by enabling the `Indicator`)
at a given point.

### Context

I won't go into a ton of detail about Bézier curves and surfaces here (there's
some great explanations out there already, like [this
one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw) by Freya Holmér). For a bit
of context though, Bézier curves are made up of some number of control points,
and any point along the curve is defined entirely by the values of these
control points. Essentially, if you know the values of each of the control
points, you also know the equation of the Bézier curve composed of those
points, which is given by the following equation.

$$
\bm{p}(u) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(u) \bm{p}_i
$$

Here, $f_i(u)$ represent **basis functions** evaluated at $u$, which, in the
case of Bézier curves are **Bernstein polynomials**, defined by the following
equation.

$$
B_{i,n}(u) = \begin{pmatrix}
n \\
i
\end{pmatrix} u^i (1-u)^{n-i}
$$

In this equation, variables have the following significance:

-   $0 \leq u \leq 1$ represents the relative distance between the start and
    end point of the Bézier curve (it's $1$ at the end of the curve and $0$ at the
    end).
-   $i$ is an integer that represents the index of the control point, (the
    starting point of the Bézier curve would have $i = 0$, the second point of the
    curve would have $i = 1$, and so on).
-   $n$ is an integer that represents the order of the Bézier curve and is
    simply equal to the number of control points in the curve - 1 (a curve with 4
    control points would have $n=3$, for example).

The app evaluates the value of the user-editable Bézier curve displayed in the
3D window at the $u$ value of the `Indicator`. It also preserves the values of
each of the basis functions used to compute the value of the curve at that
point. These values are displayed in the bar graph on the right, which is
intended to show how any point along the curve (with the exception of the start
and end points) is influenced in some part by each of the control points that
define the curve (i.e., any $u$ value except $u=0$ or $u=1$ will yield non-zero
basis functions at every control point).
