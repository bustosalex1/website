### Overview

This was a project I did for a graduate class, _ME 6104: Computer Aided Design_,
which primarily focused on understanding some of the fundamental building blocks
of modern parametric CAD software and implementing some of these concepts (like
Bézier curves and surfaces) with Python.

For the course's final project, I worked with a classmate to build a simple web
app (displayed above) with Svelte, Three.js / Threlte, TailwindCSS, and DaisyUI.
The app is designed with the intent of giving some intuition to the way Bézier
curves and surfaces work by allowing users to interact with curves and surfaces
in a 3D environment and visualize how each of the control points of the curve
affect the value of the curve (shown by enabling the `Indicator`) at a given
point.

### Context

I won't go into a ton of detail about Bézier curves and surfaces here (there's
some great explanations out there already, like
[this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVwxzDHniEw) by Freya Holmér). For a
bit of context though, Bézier curves are made up of some number of control
points, and any point along the curve is defined entirely by the values of these
control points. Essentially, if you know the values of each of the control
points, you also know the equation of the Bézier curve composed of those points,
which is given by the following equation.

$$
\bm{p}(u) = \sum_{i=0}^n f_i(u) \bm{p}_i
$$

Here, $f_i(u)$ represent **basis functions** evaluated at $u$, which, in the
case of Bézier curves are **Bernstein polynomials**, defined by the following
equation.

$$
B_{i,n}(u) = \begin{pmatrix}
n \\
i
\end{pmatrix} u^i (1-u)^{n-i}
$$

In this equation, variables have the following significance:

- $0 \leq u \leq 1$ represents the relative distance between the start and end
  point of the Bézier curve (it's $1$ at the end of the curve and $0$ at the
  end).
- $i$ is an integer that represents the index of the control point, (the
  starting point of the Bézier curve would have $i = 0$, the second point of the
  curve would have $i = 1$, and so on).
- $n$ is an integer that represents the order of the Bézier curve and is simply
  equal to the number of control points in the curve - 1 (a curve with 4 control
  points would have $n=3$, for example).

The app evaluates the value of the user-editable Bézier curve displayed in the
3D window at the $u$ value of the `Indicator`. It also preserves the values of
each of the basis functions used to compute the value of the curve at that
point. These values are displayed in the bar graph on the right, which is
intended to show how any point along the curve (with the exception of the start
and end points) is influenced in some part by each of the control points that
define the curve (i.e., any $u$ value except $u=0$ or $u=1$ will yield non-zero
basis functions at every control point).
